            Stefano Fantuzzi was born in 1980 in Italy. He grew up in a small
            village in the province of Treviso and he began to show interest in
            photography around the age of twenty. He took a short course in
            photography to learn the basic techniques, but then he decided to
            participate in various European volunteering projects for about two
            years, which led him to travel in Europe and learn French, English,
            and Spanish. After the volunteering experience he came to a
            conclusion that he needed more knowledge in photography and he
            finally enrol in a photography school in Padua where he studied for
            three years and started to look for his unique style. He then met
            the photographer Francesco Galifi and he became is assistant. In the
            meantime, he had participated in few small exhibitions with other
            photographers and in couple photography contests. After had lived
            abroad Stefano was feeling the need to move outside his country and
            now he is settle in London.
